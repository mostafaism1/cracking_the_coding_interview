## Language
The solution are in **Java**.

## Structure
- Problems are grouped in directories by topic, such as **ArraysAndString**, **LinkedLists**, etc.
- Each solution begins with listing possible solutions and giving a detailed algorithmic analysis for each one, then the **optimal** solution is implemented.
